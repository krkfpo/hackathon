# Hackathon-Group 6

In our project, we have created a web application to showcase our sport, football, and our football club, the District 6 Football Club.

We have created a home page to welcome users to the website, with social media links, a privacy policy and a contact us link at the bottom of the page.

On the home page there is a link to the about us page. On the about us page, we have provoided a brief overview of the history of our club.

There is a link to the our committee where the viewer can see a brief description of all of the players in our club.

On the links bar, there is a link to a news page which gives the user access to recent news articles.

We have implented a sign up page where the user can sign up to an email newsletter.

Finally there is a contact us page, where the user can enter their name and email, and send a message to the committee.
